My new Pluralsight course titled *[Debugging Sites Using Chrome DevTools](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/debugging-sites-chrome-devtools/table-of-contents)* will help you find and fix problems in your client-side web apps faster. The course is almost entirely demos and includes lots of tips and tricks to help you move beyond debugging with simple console.log statements. The course will be part of an upcoming learning path for client-side web development.

I hope you'll check it out and start taking advantage of the powerful tools built right into your browser!
