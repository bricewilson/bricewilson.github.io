My new-ish Pluralsight course titled *[Async Patterns in Node.js](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/nodejs-async-patterns/table-of-contents)* covers everything you need to know about writing asychronous code with Node. The course has been out a few months at this point and is part of the new [Working with Node.js](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/working-with-nodejs) learning path.

If you've ever struggled to understand the Node event loop and how it affects the code you write, then this is the course for you! It also goes into great detail on Promises, async/await, EventEmitters, and worker threads.

I hope you'll check it out and start writing faster, more responsive Node apps.
